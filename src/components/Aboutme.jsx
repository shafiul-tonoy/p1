            Hi, I'm a frontend developer with a background in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE). My passion for problem-solving and creativity led me to the exciting world of programming, where I get to build user-friendly and engaging digital experiences.

Beyond coding, I love immersing myself in books that expand my perspective and inspire new ideas. Traveling is another passion, as it allows me to explore diverse cultures and gain fresh insights. I'm constantly seeking to learn, grow, and connect through both my work and my interests.
